# EmployeeManagementSystem
I created a employee management System using spring boot and postgresql as my database.
This system consists of 5 apis : Get Employees,Post Employee, Get Employee, Put Employee, and delete employee.
The get employee api fetches all employee resources.Post employee creates a new employee resource.Get employee fetches one specific employee by id.
Put employee updates a specific employees attributes in the database.Delete employee api deletes an entire employee entry in the database. 
All apis was tested using the postman application.
